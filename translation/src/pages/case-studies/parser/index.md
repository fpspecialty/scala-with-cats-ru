<!--
In this section we will implement a parser combinator library. What are parser combinators? They are a simple way of writing parsers by composing them out of small units, such as sequencing and alternation. ...

Via the medium of parser combinators we will explore many aspects of programming in Scala, including:

- combinator librares;
- algebraic data types; and
- type classes.

... what is a combinator library ...
- build things out of small parts
- parts combine (compose) to build larger parts of the same type
- infinite complexity from small basic component and methods to combine them.
