## Sketching the Library Structure

Let's start at the bottom,
checking individual pieces of data.
Before we start coding
let's try to develop a feel
for what we'll be building.
We can use a graphical notation to help us.
We'll go through our goals one by one.

**Providing error messages**

Our first goal requires us to
associate useful error messages with a check failure.
The output of a check could be either the value being checked,
if it passed the check, or some kind of error message.
We can abstractly represent this as a value in a context,
where the context is the possibility of an error message
as shown in Figure [@fig:validation:result].

![A validation result](src/pages/case-studies/validation/result.pdf+svg){#fig:validation:result}

A check itself is therefore a function that
transforms a value into a value in a context
as shown in Figure [@fig:validation:check].

![A validation check](src/pages/case-studies/validation/check.pdf+svg){#fig:validation:check}

**Combine checks**

How do we combine smaller checks into larger ones?
Is this an applicative or semigroupal
as shown in Figure [@fig:validation:applicative]?

![Applicative combination of checks](src/pages/case-studies/validation/applicative.pdf+svg){#fig:validation:applicative}

Not really.
With applicative combination,
both checks are applied to the same value
and result in a tuple with the value repeated.
What we want feels more like a monoid
as shown in Figure [@fig:validation:monoid].
We can define a sensible identity---a check that always passes---and
two binary combination operators---*and* and *or*:

![Monoid combination of checks](src/pages/case-studies/validation/monoid.pdf+svg){#fig:validation:monoid}

We'll probably be using *and* and *or* about equally often
with our validation library
and it will be annoying to continuously
switch between two monoids for combining rules.
We consequently won't actually use the monoid API:
we'll use two separate methods, `and` and `or`, instead.

**Accumulating errors as we check**

Monoids also feel like a good mechanism
for accumulating error messages.
If we store messages as a `List` or `NonEmptyList`,
we can even use a pre-existing monoid from inside Cats.

**Transforming data as we check it**

In addition to checking data,
we also have the goal of transforming it.
This seems like it should be a `map` or a `flatMap`
depending on whether the transform can fail or not,
so it seems we also want checks to be a monad
as shown in Figure [@fig:validation:monad].

We've now broken down our library into familiar abstractions
and are in a good position to begin development.
