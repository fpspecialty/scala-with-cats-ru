# Preface {-}

The aims of this book are two-fold:
to introduce monads, functors, and other functional programming patterns
as a way to structure program design,
and to explain how these concepts are implemented in [Cats][link-cats].

Monads, and related concepts, are the functional programming equivalent
of object-oriented design patterns---architectural building blocks
that turn up over and over again in code.
They differ from object-oriented patterns in two main ways:

- they are formally, and thus precisely, defined; and
- they are extremely (extremely) general.

This generality means they can be difficult to understand.
*Everyone* finds abstraction difficult.
However, it is generality that allows concepts like monads
to be applied in such a wide variety of situations.

In this book we aim to show the concepts in a number of different ways,
to help you build a mental model
of how they work and where they are appropriate.
We have extended case studies, a simple graphical notation,
many smaller examples, and of course the mathematical definitions.
Between them we hope you'll find something that works for you.

Ok, let's get started!
